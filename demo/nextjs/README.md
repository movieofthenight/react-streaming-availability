This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
demonstrating how to use
Streaming Availability React Components.

## Getting Started

First, you need an API key to use the Streaming Availability React Components.
It's free to get it without any credit card information.
To get one, please follow the instructions in the
[Authorization Guide](https://docs.movieofthenight.com/guide/authorization).

Once you have an API key,
create a `.env` file in the root of the project
and add your API key as follows
(replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual API key):

```
STREAMING_AVAILABILITY_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
